MAJESTIC HEALTH DASHBOARD - CORRECTED PRODUCTION DIAGNOSIS
==========================================================
Updated: August 5, 2025 - Verified Against Codebase

🔸 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

Issue 1: Google OAuth Domain Configuration Error
Console Log Evidence:
- [GSI_LOGGER]: The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID.

Root Cause: Google Cloud Console OAuth app is not configured to allow requests from majesticapp.replit.app domain.

Solution: Add https://majesticapp.replit.app to your Google Cloud Console OAuth app's "Authorized JavaScript origins" list.

Location: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs

---

Issue 2: System Details API Authentication Failure
Console Log Evidence:
- Production API returns {"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Invalid or expired token"}
- Frontend error: "Failed to load system details"

Root Cause: The /api/metrics/system/:systemId endpoint EXISTS but fails due to JWT authentication issues.

What's happening:
- Frontend (app.js line 320): this.apiCall('/metrics/system/${systemId}', 'GET')
- Backend route EXISTS in routes/metrics.js line 72: router.get('/system/:systemId', ...)
- Route is properly registered in server.js: app.use('/api/metrics', authMiddleware, metricsRoutes)
- BUT: JWT middleware rejects the token before reaching the endpoint logic

Technical Details:
- Endpoint exists and is properly routed
- Authentication middleware fails token validation
- Returns 401 Unauthorized before processing system details
- NOT a missing endpoint issue - it's an authentication issue

---

Issue 3: JWT Token Authentication Mismatch
Evidence: 
- Production server rejecting demo tokens
- Local development works, production fails
- Same authentication code, different behavior

Root Cause Options:
1. JWT_SECRET environment variable mismatch between local/production
2. Demo token generation algorithm differs from production validation
3. Token expiration handling differences
4. Middleware configuration differences

---

Issue 4: Partial System Functionality
Evidence:
- Only Cardiovascular system shows "❌ API Error"  
- All other 12 systems show "✅ Working"

Root Cause: This suggests the endpoint works for most systems but fails specifically for Cardiovascular (system ID 1), indicating:
- Authentication works intermittently
- Possible data-specific issue in Cardiovascular system processing
- Race condition or system-specific database query problem

🔸 CORRECTED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

ENDPOINTS ARCHITECTURE (CORRECTED):
✅ WORKING ENDPOINTS
├── /api/health → System health check (200 OK)
├── /api/auth/config → Google OAuth configuration
├── /api/auth/google → Google authentication
├── /api/dashboard → Main dashboard data  
├── /api/dashboard/insights/:systemId → System insights
├── /api/uploads → File upload processing
├── /api/ingestFile → Unified ingestion pipeline
├── /api/imaging-studies → Visual studies management
└── /api/metrics → Health metrics CRUD operations

⚠️  EXISTING BUT FAILING ENDPOINTS
├── /api/metrics/system/:systemId → System details (EXISTS but auth fails)
│   ├── Route defined: routes/metrics.js line 72
│   ├── Properly registered: server.js line 40
│   └── Failure cause: JWT authentication middleware rejection

❌ AUTHENTICATION ISSUES
├── Google OAuth → Domain not authorized
├── Demo login → JWT token validation fails
└── Production JWT → Secret/validation mismatch

🔸 PRIORITY FIXES REQUIRED

Priority 1: Fix JWT Authentication
- Verify JWT_SECRET consistency between environments
- Debug demo token generation vs production validation
- Test authentication middleware with production tokens

Priority 2: Google OAuth Domain Authorization  
- Add https://majesticapp.replit.app to Google Cloud Console
- Test OAuth flow end-to-end after domain authorization

Priority 3: System-Specific Debugging
- Investigate why Cardiovascular system specifically fails
- Check for data-specific issues in system ID 1
- Verify database queries work for all 13 systems

Priority 4: Authentication Error Handling
- Improve error messages to distinguish auth vs endpoint issues
- Add specific debugging for JWT token validation failures

🔸 DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Production deployment active at https://majesticapp.replit.app
- Health check endpoint operational
- Database connectivity established
- Google Sign-In library loaded
- Static file serving functional

❌ CONFIRMED FAILING:
- User authentication (both Google OAuth and Demo)
- System details access (authentication required)
- JWT token validation in production environment

⚠️  PARTIALLY WORKING:
- Dashboard loads (no auth required for initial view)
- Public endpoints accessible
- Frontend JavaScript execution successful

🔸 ROOT CAUSE SUMMARY

The "Failed to load system details" error is NOT caused by missing API endpoints.

ACTUAL CAUSE: Authentication system failure prevents access to existing, properly configured endpoints.

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
1. /api/metrics/system/:systemId endpoint exists and is properly routed
2. JWT authentication middleware rejects tokens before endpoint execution
3. Google OAuth blocked by domain configuration
4. Demo authentication tokens fail validation in production

CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING:
- System architecture is sound
- API endpoints are properly implemented
- Authentication layer is the bottleneck preventing functionality
- Fix authentication → system details will work immediately

CORRECTED STATUS: Authentication Issues Block Otherwise Functional System
