- ‚úÖ Comprehensive health assessment - Combined lab and imaging data provides holistic system-level insights
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized queries - Limited to 10 most recent studies per system using existing database indexes
- ‚úÖ Enhanced queue processing - Added visual studies support to direct processing mode when Redis unavailable
- ‚úÖ Study type mapping completion - Added keratometry ‚Üí Sensory system mapping for comprehensive eye study support
- ‚úÖ Updated system documentation - Complete system graph reflects all current features and deployment configuration

AUGUST 1, 2025 - UNIFIED INGESTION PIPELINE

- ‚úÖ Visual study processing - Extracts metrics and findings from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, eye studies using GPT-4o
- ‚úÖ Thumbnail generation - Sharp library integration for image thumbnails and PDF placeholders
- ‚úÖ Study comparison system - AI-powered trend analysis comparing current vs previous studies
- ‚úÖ System integration - Visual studies automatically linked to appropriate body systems (1-13)
- ‚úÖ New API endpoints - /api/ingestFile and /api/imaging-studies for unified pipeline access
- ‚úÖ Enhanced system drill-down - Studies & Imaging section added to system detail modals
- ‚úÖ DICOM support - Phase 1 stores DICOM files without processing (future phases will add analysis)
