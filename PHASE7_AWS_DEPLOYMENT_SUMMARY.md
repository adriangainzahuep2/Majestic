- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment with override configuration
- **Docker ignore**: Optimized build process by excluding unnecessary files

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Automation
- **Comprehensive deploy script**: 827-line `deploy_aws_complete.sh` with 11 deployment steps
- **RDS PostgreSQL 15.8**: Automatic schema migration and backup configuration
- **ECS Cluster**: Auto-scaling (1-3 instances) with Application Load Balancer
- **S3 Integration**: Schema versioning and file storage
- **Security**: IAM roles, security groups, VPC networking

### 3. EC2 Instance Management (No SSH Required)
- **User data script**: `user-data.sh` for automated instance initialization
- **RDS connection testing**: Multiple methods without SSH access
- **Systems Manager integration**: AWS SSM for instance management
- **Schema migration**: Automatic database setup from S3
- **ECS agent configuration**: Container orchestration setup

### 4. Connection Testing Alternatives
- **AWS Systems Manager**: No SSH required for instance access
- **PostgreSQL client testing**: Direct database connectivity validation
- **Network connectivity**: Port and DNS testing
- **RDS API monitoring**: Instance status and health checks
- **Comprehensive test script**: `test-rds-connection.sh` with multiple methods

### 5. Validation & Documentation
- **Deployment validation**: `validate-deployment.sh` with 24-point validation
- **Environment template**: `.env.template` with all required variables
- **Complete guide**: `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with troubleshooting
- **Deployment summary**: Automatic generation of connection information
