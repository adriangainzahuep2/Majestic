Got it — here’s how to get your app working again after nuking and recreating the dev DB. (Advice only.)

1) Quick diagnosis

When you recreate a DB, the schema, extensions, RLS/permissions, and seed data are gone. Your app boots, but:
	•	queries hit missing tables/columns
	•	auth/lookup tables are empty
	•	your ORM client is out of sync with the new schema
	•	env vars may point to the wrong DB instance

2) Fix plan (order matters)
	1.	Point your app and your migration tool to the SAME database
	•	Check DATABASE_URL (and any read/write URLs) in Replit Secrets.
	•	Ensure the ORM/migration tool uses that exact URL.
	2.	Recreate the schema by running migrations
	•	Drizzle:

# regenerate SQL from current schema (optional if you already have migrations)
npx drizzle-kit generate
# apply migrations to the new DB
npx drizzle-kit migrate


	•	Prisma (if you use it):

npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate


	•	Knex/TypeORM/etc.: run the equivalent “migrate” command.

	3.	Install required DB extensions / enums / policies
	•	Re-run any scripts that create extensions (e.g., uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, etc.) and custom types.
	•	Recreate RLS policies, GRANTs, roles, and indexes your app depends on.
	4.	Seed essential data
	•	Run your seed script to populate required reference rows (roles, plans, feature flags, test users, etc.).
	•	Typical:

npm run seed


	•	If you don’t have a seed script, create one from a recent dump or export minimal CSV/SQL for lookups.

	5.	Regenerate your ORM client
	•	Drizzle: ensure the generated types are up to date (e.g., drizzle-kit generate then rebuild).
	•	Prisma: npx prisma generate.
	6.	Redeploy / restart the Replit process
	•	Kill/restart the repl so it picks up the new schema and regenerated client.
	7.	Clear app caches that assume old IDs
	•	In-memory caches, edge caches, or build artifacts may still reference old table shapes.
	8.	Run a drift check
	•	Drizzle: drizzle-kit check (or inspect the DB) to confirm DB == schema.
	•	Prisma: prisma migrate status.

3) Common “gotchas” that break features
	•	Wrong DB target for migrations (tool pointed at DB A; app pointed at DB B).
	•	Missing seed data (feature flags, default org, admin user).
	•	Auth tables not recreated (e.g., for email/password or OAuth state).
	•	Foreign keys to rows that don’t exist (creates silent 0-results).
	•	Environment variables not updated after you recreated the DB (new host/DB name/password).
	•	Functions/Triggers not reinstalled.

4) If you previously mixed providers (e.g., migrations → Neon, app → Supabase)
	•	Pick ONE provider for dev.
	•	Move migrations to the same DB used by the app.
	•	Export/import a dump if needed so everything lives together.

5) Replit-specific sanity checks
	•	Re-check Secrets panel for DATABASE_URL.
	•	If using a local DB file (SQLite): confirm the file path and that it’s checked into the repl or created on boot.
	•	Ensure the start command (Procfile/replit.nix/package.json scripts) runs migrations before starting the server in dev.

6) Prevent this next time
	•	Add a bootstrap script that does, in order: create extensions → run migrations → seed → start app.
	•	Keep a minimal seed (users, org, roles, config) versioned in the repo.
	•	Add a prestart hook in package.json:

"scripts": {
  "prestart": "npx drizzle-kit migrate && npm run seed || true",
  "start": "node server.js"
}


	•	Periodically dump dev data you care about.

Follow the sequence above and most broken features should come back once schema + seed are restored and both app & migration tool point to the same DB.
