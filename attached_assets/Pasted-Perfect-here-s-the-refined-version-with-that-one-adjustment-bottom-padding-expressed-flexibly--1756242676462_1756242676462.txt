Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the refined version with that one adjustment (bottom padding expressed flexibly as ‚â•96px, not Tailwind-specific):

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT: Fix Profile ‚Äî Unit Toggle Highlight, Page Cut-off, Save Action (+ bottom spacing)

‚∏ª

Scope (only these fixes)
	‚Ä¢	Persist/reflect selected Unit System (US / SI) with a highlighted state that remains after selection and on reload.
	‚Ä¢	Remove the page cut-off/freeze below Save Profile and ensure visible space continues after the button.
	‚Ä¢	Wire Save Profile so it performs the PUT request, shows success/failure, and doesn‚Äôt silently fail.

‚∏ª

Requirements
	1.	Unit System toggle (persist + highlight)

	‚Ä¢	Profile page only (not global).
	‚Ä¢	Selecting US or SI (metric):
	‚Ä¢	Visually highlight the active option (selected style) and keep it on reload (read from /api/profile).
	‚Ä¢	Update local state immediately; include preferred_unit_system on save.
	‚Ä¢	Styling: keep Majestic aesthetic; if no selected style exists, use a minimal border or background shade.

	2.	Page should scroll past ‚ÄúSave Profile‚Äù with visible bottom space

	‚Ä¢	Fix layout so the page fully scrolls; remove any clipping (overflow: hidden) or fixed heights causing cutoff.
	‚Ä¢	Add bottom padding/spacing on the scroll container of at least 96px or equivalent so there is comfortable space below the Save button.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the Save button is never flush with the viewport edge or overlapped by mobile browser chrome/sticky elements.

	3.	Save Profile works (PUT + user feedback)

	‚Ä¢	On click:
	‚Ä¢	Disable button and show ‚ÄúSaving‚Ä¶‚Äù (or spinner).
	‚Ä¢	PUT /api/profile with payload:

{
  "preferred_unit_system": "US" | "SI",
  "height_in": <int or null>,
  "weight_lb": <number or null>,
  "country_of_residence": "<ISO alpha-2>"
}

	‚Ä¢	On success: re-enable button; show non-intrusive success feedback (toast/banner consistent with Majestic aesthetic). Keep toggle highlight.
	‚Ä¢	On failure: re-enable button; show error feedback (‚ÄúFailed to save profile. Please try again.‚Äù). No silent failures.

‚∏ª

Do NOT change
	‚Ä¢	No new fields, conversions, or schema changes.
	‚Ä¢	No navigation or global toggles.
	‚Ä¢	No animations.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt modify other pages/APIs beyond this PUT.

‚∏ª

Acceptance Criteria
	‚Ä¢	Toggle persistence: Selected US/SI remains highlighted after reload (reflects /api/profile).
	‚Ä¢	Scrollable page: Content scrolls past Save button with ‚â•96px visible space below (no cutoff).
	‚Ä¢	Save works: PUT occurs; button disables during request; success/error feedback shown; no silent fail.
	‚Ä¢	No regressions: Existing styling/inputs intact.

‚∏ª

QA Checklist
	‚Ä¢	Load Profile ‚Üí correct toggle highlighted from API.
	‚Ä¢	Switch SI ‚Üî US ‚Üí highlight persists; fields swap correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Scroll test ‚Üí can scroll past Save button; confirm ~96px+ space below.
	‚Ä¢	Save success ‚Üí ‚ÄúProfile saved.‚Äù shown; reload keeps selection.
	‚Ä¢	Save failure (mock 400) ‚Üí error feedback shown; button re-enabled.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile check ‚Üí Save button not obscured by browser chrome; bottom spacing still present.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Now it‚Äôs flexible: ‚Äú‚â•96px bottom space‚Äù instead of Tailwind‚Äôs pb-24. Keeps your MVP clean and framework-agnostic.

Do you also want me to add that the success/error messages should disappear automatically after a short time (e.g., 3‚Äì4s), or should they stay until the user dismisses?
