Task

Keep everything lightweight, dropdown-driven where possible, and styled in Majestic’s calm/Apple-like aesthetic.

⸻

Minimal UI (Navigation)
	•	Top right corner: circular avatar with user initials.
	•	On click → dropdown with “Profile” option.

	•	Pacific Islander
	•	Mixed / Other
	•	Prefer not to say
	•	Country of Residence: dropdown (full ISO country list)

⸻

Chronic Conditions (time-bounded, collapsible section — expanded by default)
Each entry:
	•	Condition: dropdown (scaffold only, leave blank for now)
	•	Show placeholder text: “Select condition (list updating soon)”
	•	Status: Active / Resolved

⸻

Lifestyle (rolling, collapsible section — expanded by default)

	•	Alcohol: “# of drinks per week.”

	•	Pregnant? Y/N
	•	If Yes → pregnancy_start_date (infers trimester automatically)

⸻

Constraints
	•	Keep styling minimal, modern, Majestic aesthetic (Apple Health / Calm style).
	•	Use dropdowns/toggles wherever possible, not free text.
	•	Profile sections should be collapsible but expanded by default for usability.
	•	Do not add analytics, unit conversion, or HealthKit integration yet.
	•	Scaffold chronic conditions dropdown but leave empty with placeholder text until config file is added later.
