Prompt for Replit Agent – Deep Diagnostics for Insights Save/Fetch Mismatch

⸻

Context

From recent logs:
	1.	Save succeeds:
[INSIGHTS SAVE CONFIRMED] ai_outputs_log record saved successfully
	2.	Fetch immediately after save retrieves old data:
overall_status":"good" (stale)
	3.	Compare shows mismatch:
justSavedPayload = At Risk
fetchedPayload = old stable record
	4.	Post-save verify returns old data (not what was just saved).

This means:
The new GPT output is being written but not retrieved by getLatestSystemInsights.

⸻

Possible Root Causes
	1.	Wrong output_type:
The save may use output_type='system_insights', while fetch filters for system_insights_cardiovascular.
	2.	Stale created_at / ordering bug:
If the update does not set created_at correctly, ORDER BY created_at DESC may select an older record.
	3.	Transaction/commit issue:
The save might be done in a transaction that isn’t committed before the immediate fetch.

⸻

Required Diagnostic Additions (NO FIXES)

1. Log During Save

In the function that writes insights to ai_outputs_log, before performing the INSERT/UPDATE:

console.log("[DEBUG SAVE PREP]", {
  userId,
  systemId,
  output_type,
  payloadKeys: Object.keys(insights),
});

After executing the INSERT/UPDATE:
	•	Log the SQL (or ORM query) used, and include:
	•	user_id
	•	output_type
	•	created_at
	•	id (primary key)
	•	affectedRows/returning row ID

console.log("[DEBUG SAVE SQL]", { sql, params });
console.log("[DEBUG SAVE RESULT]", saveResult);

⸻

2. Direct DB Check After Save

Immediately after saving and before calling getLatestSystemInsights, run:

const recent = await db.query(
  SELECT id, output_type, created_at
  FROM ai_outputs_log
  WHERE user_id = $1
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 5
, [userId]);

console.log("[DEBUG RECENT ROWS]", recent.rows);

This will show whether a new row actually exists, its output_type, and whether created_at is correct.

⸻

3. Log Output Type in Fetch

Inside db.getLatestSystemInsights, before the query:

console.log("[DEBUG FETCH FILTER]", { userId, systemId, output_type });

After running the query, log the SQL and params, and confirm which row was selected.

⸻

4. Compare Saved vs Fetched

Already present, but keep:

console.log("[COMPARE SAVE vs FETCH]", {
  userId,
  systemId,
  justSavedPayload: JSON.stringify(insights).slice(0, 500),
  fetchedPayload: JSON.stringify(verify).slice(0, 500)
});

⸻

Expected Results
	•	If the recent rows log shows the new row under a different output_type,
→ Fix is to standardize output_type naming.
	•	If the recent rows log shows the new row has an old created_at or no new row is added,
→ The bug is in the save query (created_at not updated).
	•	If the recent rows log shows the new row correctly but fetch still returns old data,
→ The fetch query’s WHERE/ORDER BY logic is wrong (e.g., wrong output_type).
	•	If no new row appears at all,
→ The save isn’t being committed properly.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Add 3 new diagnostic logs:
	1.	[DEBUG SAVE PREP] + [DEBUG SAVE SQL/RESULT]
	2.	[DEBUG RECENT ROWS]
	3.	[DEBUG FETCH FILTER]
	•	Do not modify any logic or data.
	•	The purpose is to produce a full audit trail of:
	•	What is being saved
	•	Where it is being saved
	•	Why the fetch does not return the latest record.

⸻

Why This Approach

This approach:
	•	Fully eliminates guesswork on output_type.
	•	Ensures ordering (created_at) problems are visible.
	•	Ensures commit/transaction problems are visible.
	•	Avoids another round of “add more logs” by giving us a full picture.

⸻

After running this, the logs will tell us exactly why the stale data is being fetched.
