EVALUATE THIS PROMPT TO MAKE SURE IT'S GREAT. DON'T TAKE ANY ACTION JUST EVALUATE. [[Here’s the updated and clarified prompt for the Replit Agent.
It removes the “Recent Uploads” table from system drill‑down pages and adds explicit instructions to clean up empty containers and spacing:

⸻

Update: Remove “Recent Uploads” from System Pages

Required Change:
In every System drill‑down page (e.g., Cardiovascular, Sensory, etc.), remove the “Recent Uploads” table/section that currently appears at the bottom of the page.

⸻

What Should Remain on a System Page:
Each system page must now show only these sections (in order):
	1.	Key Metrics (table)
	2.	Additional Metrics (table)
	3.	AI Analysis (existing section)
	4.	Studies & Imaging (if any, from linkedSystemId)
	5.	Trends (if any)

⸻

What to Remove:
	•	The “Recent Uploads” table currently showing uploaded files (before they are processed) on each system page.
	•	This section is no longer needed on a per‑system basis.

⸻

Important:
	•	Do not remove or modify any other sections.
	•	The global dashboard/timeline (outside of system pages) must continue showing “Recent Uploads”.
	•	This removal applies only to individual system drill‑down pages.

⸻

Impact:
	•	No backend or database changes.
	•	Frontend-only change: Remove rendering of the Recent Uploads table/section in system drill‑down components.
	•	Ensure that processed results still appear in the correct sections (Key Metrics, Additional Metrics, Studies & Imaging, Trends).

⸻

Follow-up Cleanup Instructions:
After removing the “Recent Uploads” table:
	•	Remove any empty containers, blank rows, or spacing left behind.
	•	Check that page layouts remain visually consistent (no blank area where the table used to be).
	•	Verify that section titles and content flow directly from one to the next with no placeholder gap.

⸻

Goal:
System drill‑down pages should feel clean and seamless, with only the sections listed above.

⸻

This prompt ensures the section is removed cleanly without breaking layout or other functionality.
