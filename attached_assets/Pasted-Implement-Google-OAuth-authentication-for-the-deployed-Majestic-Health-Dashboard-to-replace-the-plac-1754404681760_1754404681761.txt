Implement Google OAuth authentication for the deployed Majestic Health Dashboard to replace the placeholder "Google OAuth would be implemented here" message.
Requirements:
1. Configure Google OAuth 2.0 client credentials in the Google Cloud Console
2. Update the frontend login button to use actual Google OAuth flow using the google-auth-library
3. Ensure the existing JWT token system continues to work with Google user data
4. Maintain compatibility with the current authentication middleware and user database schema
5. Configure required environment variables: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
6. Test the complete login flow: Google OAuth → JWT token → authenticated dashboard access
Current status:
- Backend auth routes are functional (/api/auth/google exists)
- Frontend shows placeholder message instead of real OAuth
- Database user table supports Google ID and user profiles
- JWT authentication system is working
- google-auth-library dependency is already installed
Expected outcome:
- Users can click "Continue with Google" and complete real OAuth flow
- Successful authentication redirects to dashboard with working session
- User profile data (name, email, avatar) populates from Google account
- All existing dashboard functionality remains operational
- Demo authentication continues to work as fallback
Implementation priorities:
1. Use existing authentication architecture without breaking current functionality
2. Leverage the installed google-auth-library for OAuth token verification
3. Request Google OAuth secrets from user if not already configured
4. Maintain backward compatibility with demo login for testing
5. Ensure production-ready error handling for OAuth failures
Success criteria:
- Real Google login replaces placeholder message
- OAuth flow redirects properly to dashboard
- User data persists correctly in existing database schema
- No disruption to current authenticated users or demo functionality
Key Improvements:

Specific Library Reference - Mentions google-auth-library (already installed)
Environment Variables - Lists required GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
Secrets Handling - Instructs to request OAuth secrets from user
Fallback Preservation - Maintains demo login as testing backup
Error Handling - Specifies production-ready OAuth failure handling
Priority Order - Implementation priorities ranked by importance
Dependency Status - Notes library is already available
