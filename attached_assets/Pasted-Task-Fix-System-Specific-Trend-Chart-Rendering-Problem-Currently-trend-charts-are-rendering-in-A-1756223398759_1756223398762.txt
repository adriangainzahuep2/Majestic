Task: Fix System-Specific Trend Chart Rendering

Problem: Currently, trend charts are rendering in ALL system drill-down modals if any key metric has ≥2 data points, regardless of which system the metric actually belongs to. For example, cardiovascular metrics like "LDL" are appearing in the Sensory system modal.

Objective: Ensure trend charts only render for metrics that actually belong to the specific system being viewed.

Root Cause: The getSystemTrends(userId, systemId) method in services/healthSystems.js correctly filters by system_id in the database query, but the visual studies processing doesn't validate system ownership before including metrics in the response.

Changes Needed:

Fix visual studies processing in getSystemTrends():
Currently processes ALL visual studies for the system without validating metric ownership
Add validation using this.isKeyMetric(systemId, measurementName) before including visual study metrics
Only include measurements that are actually key metrics for the requested system
Add system validation logic:
Before adding any metric to trendsResponse, verify it belongs to the current system
Use the existing isKeyMetric(systemId, metricName) function to validate
Only include metrics where the validation returns true
Expected Behavior After Fix:

Cardiovascular system: Shows only LDL, HDL, Blood Pressure trends
Sensory system: Shows only eye/hearing-related metric trends
Each system: Shows only its own relevant key metrics with ≥2 data points
Empty trend section: Hidden when no system-specific metrics have ≥2 data points
Technical Details:

The database query already filters by system_id correctly for lab metrics
The issue is in visual studies processing - it includes ALL measurements without system validation
Frontend trend rendering logic is correct - just receiving wrong data from backend
Files to modify:

services/healthSystems.js - Add system validation in getSystemTrends() visual studies processing
This ensures trends are system-specific and eliminates cross-system metric bleeding.
